# Deliverable-4

Overview

This project investigates how studentsâ€™ digital media usage (social media hours, streaming, multitasking, using platforms for study, etc.) relates to their academic outcomes and their perception of whether digital media helps or harms them.

The repo includes:

The original survey dataset

A data preprocessing notebook that cleans and encodes the survey responses

A model development & training notebook that builds machine learning models

Saved trained models (.pkl files) for reuse

requirements.txt to recreate the environment

This README explains how to set up the environment, run preprocessing, train and evaluate the models, and interpret the outputs.
